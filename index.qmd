## Today's Outline

::: {style="font-size: 32px"}

In this talk, I will be briefly talking about

1. The Place of Education for Sustainable Development in Türkiye's Teacher Education Context
2. Setting the Scene: Study Context
3. Turkish Pre-service Teachers' Perspectives on Sustainability
4. Brief discussion on pre-service teachers' understanding of sustainability and implications for SDG 4.7.

### ESD in Türkiye's Teacher Education Context
::: {style="font-size: 32px"}

- A centralised education system
- Teacher education programmes are offered by higher education institutions(Bourn & Soysal, 2021; TEDMEM, 2021)
- 4-year undergraduate programmes determined by Council of Higher Education (2018)
- Several (under)graduate ESD courses in teacher education programmes has been offered more than 10 years sporadically (Tuncer, 2008; Tuncer & Sahin, 2016).
- *Sustainable Development and Education* was included as one of the Teaching Specialty Elective Courses by Council of Higher Education in 2018.
- Since then, the number of universities offer this course is increasing.

- Two complementary studies' evidences are presented and discussed in terms of SDG 4.7.
- The aim of these studies can be summarized as following:
  - assess pre service teachers’ knowledge of sustainability
  - explore pre-service teachers’ self-efficacy beliefs on integrating sustainability into their profession and daily lives.
- Data was collected from a public university in Ankara, capital city of Türkiye.

### Data Analysis -I
::: {style="font-size: 28px"}
::: fragment
::: nonincremental

Basic qualitative research design (Merriam & Tisdell, 2015) was chosen to be able to explore understandings of pre-service teachers in depth.

In data analysis, we intended to (1) emerge profiles of pre-service teachers that reflect their understandings on sustainability.

  - If the participants specify the dimensions of sustainability and explain the interrelationships among them, we categorized them as **informed as explicit**
  - If the participants did not specify the dimensions of sustainability and the interrelationships among them but they explained all of these in an indirect way, we categorized them as **informed as implicit**
  - If the participants specified the dimensions of sustainability but did not explain them and their interrelationships among them, we categorized them as **non-informed**

After profiles were emerged, (2) profiles were compared by their department and two researchers were coded the interviews.

#### Pre-service Teachers' Understanding of Sustainability - I

::: {style="font-size: 22px"}

A semi-structured interview was conducted to understand how pre-service teachers perceive the dimensions of sustainability (Macer, 2004) from **economical**, **social**, **cultural**, and **ecological** perspectives as well as the **interactions** among these dimensions.

|**Department/Major**                   |**Frequency** (*n*)
|:---------                             |:--------------:
|Early Childhood Education (ECE)        | 10
|Elementary Science Education (ESE)     | 10
|Elementary Mathematics Education (EME) | 9
|**Total**                              | **29**


The sustainability courses available in the Faculty of Education were as following:

| Course                                              | Must Elective       | Offered to
| :----------------------------                       | :-----------:       | :--------:
| Education and Awareness for Sustainability          | Elective Course     | All
| Climate Change Education for Sustainability         | Elective Course     | All   
| Laboratory Applications in Environmental Education  | Elective Course     | All
| Environmental Sciences                              | Must Course         | ESE
| Basic Science                                       | Must Course         | ECE
| Teaching Science in Early Childhood                 | Must Course         | ECE

- To ensure that all learners acquire the knowledge and skills needed to promote sustainable development through education for sustainable development, we need to increase our capacity to the extent to which (i) global citizenship education and (ii) education for sustainable development are mainstreamed in (a) national education policies; (b) curricula; (c) teacher education and (d) student assessment (Indicator 4.7.1).
- To examine the role of embedding sustainability concepts into teacher education programme, two complementary studies were shared to explore pre-service teachers'
  - understandings of sustainability through the ecological, economic, social and cultural aspects
  - self-efficacy beliefs about integration sustainability concepts into their teaching and daily life.
- In the first study, we identified that elementary science pre-service teachers who enrolled both must and elective ESD courses had a more complex understanding than their peers
  - We also observed that enrolling an elective course might not be enough to develop a sound understanding about the interactions between those dimensions.

### Discussion and Conclusion - II

::: {style="font-size: 20px"}
::: fragment

- In the second study, we assessed self-efficacy beliefs of pre-service teachers who enrolled a general elective course on sustainability
  - We identified that even though the pre-service teachers seemed to be hopeful about 'find better ways' to integrate sustainability into their daily lives, nearly 40% of them remained undecided on how to integrate sustainability into their teaching.
- Overall, we believe that even though enrolling a general elective ESD course is important as an initial step, to be able to raise ESD competent teachers, we need to embed ESD into teacher education programmes (e.g., discipline specific courses & embedding sustainability concepts into other modules/lectures) which, in turn, contribute to achieving SDGs.
  - Some available studies (e.g.,Cockerell, 2020; Ferguson & Roofe, 2020) also argued in a similar vein that more explicit and coordinated efforts are needed to achieve SDG 4.
